          <br />
          On this Rose Day, each petal symbolizes my admiration <br />for you.
          Your presence colors my world with joy and warmth.Like a rose in full
          bloom, "Apricity" which means "The Warmth of the sun in winter" ur just like this , you give me vibes of yk like there's field of green grass and warm sunlight is lluminating it and in that field of grass there are flowers and plants where butterflies r wandering around then looking astonishing in that warm sunlight , and also we are those silly otters ;)
